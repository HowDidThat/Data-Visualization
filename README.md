# Data-Visualization

## Introduction

The first step contains is an introductory step with some information about [charts](/Step1/Charts.md) and basic information about the 
necessary [software](/Step1/Prerequisites.md) and how to install it.

In development of this program I will be using a linux based machine running [Pop_os](https://pop.system76.com/) 
and [PyCharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  as the main IDE, but the setup should be similar for other platforms.

## Lecture partition

The main lecture will be split into 4 steps:

- Step 1: Initiation, where we will talk about charts and the required software and libraries
and their respective installation process.
- Step 2: Will go a little into data manipulation in python and cvs.
- Step 3: Introduction to the matplotlib library and the necessary functions to create the graph.
- Step 4: Will be a step by step for creating our bar plot.

## Exercises

Lecture 2 and 3 contain an exercise that is explained step by step and a harder
one without any help, and the completed exercise can be found in the solution file.
