# Charts

A chart is way to represent data using different shapes and colors. They can help us visualize complex information very quickly, 
as we can transform large and bulky datasets into a visual representation. This power can be used to simplify and aid our
understanding of data and concepts.

There are a lot of different types of chart but the most common ones are:

- bar chart - comparing quantities 
- pie chart - percentages, parts of a whole
- line chart - functions, change over time

In the following tutorial we will be focusing primarily on bar charts, and their uses in combination with datasets for 
representing data.
